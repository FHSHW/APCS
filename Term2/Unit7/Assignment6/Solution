Hi Martin, 
 
A user should be able to enter stop in any form. When I tried your code in
DrJava I entered 'stop' and it looks like we hit an infinite loop. Take a look
at your insertionSort algorithm and make sure you are changing the size of the
array. 
 
Also you do not need to write insertionSort to pass this assignment. All you
need to do is to make sure that you enter each individual String in order. So
for each consecutive String you decide where to place it in the array. You
simply insert the first String, then for the second you see is it greater than
or equal to or less than the first String, then you either add it to the end of
the array of the beginning. Sorting the array as you go is simpler than doing it
after all the names are inserted.
